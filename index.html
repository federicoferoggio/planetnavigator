      <div class="details-body">
        <p>On the Sun Side, Fire Genasi navigate a molten landscape, sailing on seas of lava in heat-resistant ships.
          They harvest precious minerals from the fiery depths, thriving in a world where the air shimmers with
          unbearable heat. Meanwhile, on the Space Side, Air Genasi glide over frozen expanses, extracting rare crystals
          from towering ice formations. Their ships, designed to resist the biting cold, cut through the ice, revealing
          treasures preserved for ages.</p>
        <p>Between these extremes lies the twilight border, where cities balance fire and ice to create habitable
          spaces. The Sudriz family, rulers of Hellcoast, embody this balance. Known for their mediocrity and methodical
          governance, they maintain a stable yet unremarkable rule, mirroring the precarious equilibrium of their

      </div>
      <div class="details-body">
        <h3>A Deserted Landscape</h3>
        <p>Jetaras is largely an arid, inhospitable wasteland. Temperatures frequently soar above 50 degrees Celsius
          (122 degrees Fahrenheit), turning the land into a barren, cracked expanse of earth and rock. Dust storms sweep
          across this harsh landscape, making travel and survival a constant challenge. The only respite from the
          relentless heat is found in the shade of the rare shelters or within the towering Ultracities that rise from
          the desert like colossal oases.
        </p>
        <h3>The Three Great Plateaus and Ultracities</h3>
        <p>The planet's three colossal plateaus are home to the Ultracities, sprawling urban centers where over a
          hundred million people live. These cities, with their towering "Work Towers," are marvels of human
          engineering, each one a self-contained world organized into sectors dedicated to industry, commerce, and
          living spaces. Surrounding these towers are vast slums, where life is a daily struggle against poverty and
          oppression. Despite the harsh conditions, these slums are vibrant with culture, filled with markets, music,
          and a strong sense of community.
        </p>
        <h3>The Warlord Provinces</h3>
        <p>Beyond the plateaus lie the Warlord Provinces, a lawless expanse where powerful warlords rule with an iron
          fist. These territories are patrolled by private armies, and the lands are plagued by ravagers who prey on the
          weak. Caravans that dare to cross these regions are at constant risk of attack, yet trade remains vital, and
          so the caravans continue, heavily guarded and always on high alert.
        </p>
        <h3>The Mitsumoro Family</h3>
        <p>The Mitsumoro family, one of the three most powerful families in the Stardom, rules over Jetaras with a blend
          of cunning and ruthlessness. They maintain control through a complex web of contracts that bind every citizen
          to them from birth. Asmodeus, the archdevil of indulgence, is their chosen deity, and under his influence, the
          Mitsumoro have built a society where pleasure, wealth, and power are paramount. Despite their hedonistic
          lifestyle, the Mitsumoro are masters of manipulation, ensuring that any challenge to their dominance is
          swiftly neutralized.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="details-body">
        <p>The Void is all that remains of the once-thriving planet of Meerswelt. Now, it is a desolate expanseâ€”a
          shattered graveyard of floating debris, where countless asteroids drift through the cold, empty darkness.
          These fragments are the remnants of the old world, broken pieces of land from the destroyed planet, scattered
          across the cosmos like the shards of a forgotten dream.

          At the center of this vast, ruined sea, a greenish vapor swirls, growing denser and darker the closer one gets
          to the middle. This fog is thick with an otherworldly malevolence, a choking miasma that wraps around
          everything it touches. At its heart lies a small, insatiable black hole, pulling all matter toward itâ€”a
          one-way ticket to the Abyss, a gateway to a dimension of destruction and death.

          But even here, amidst the ruins, there are those who survive. On some of the larger asteroids, pockets of
          determined warriors and exiles make their stand. They eke out a living among the rocks, fighting back the
          endless waves of demons and horrors that emerge from the depths of the Abyss, battling for survival against
          the very embodiment of chaos and annihilation.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="details-body">
        <p>
        <h3>A Warped Planet</h3>
        <p>Once a world of vibrant prairies, Draconia has been irreversibly transformed by the magical influence of its
          dragon rulers. Each type of chromatic dragon has claimed a portion of the planet, warping the environment to
          reflect their elemental powers. The ancient Red Dragons have turned mountains into active volcanoes, their
          domains flowing with rivers of molten lava. In the deep chasms ruled by the Black Dragons, sulfuric acid lakes
          bubble ominously, while the White Dragons have plunged their territories into icy tundras where temperatures
          drop far below zero. The seas, governed by the Blue Dragons, are a perpetual storm, crackling with electrical
          discharges that make navigation treacherous. Meanwhile, the Green Dragons preside over lush, dangerous
          jungles, teeming with monstrous creatures. These transformed landscapes create isolated, hostile environments
          where only the strongest survive.</p>

        <h3>The Chosen of the Queen</h3>
        <p>Dominating this fractured world is the Wueng family, descendants of Zai Wueng, the Voice of Tiamat. Blessed
          by the Dragon Queen herself, the Wuengs possess the power to command the chromatic dragons, wielding this
          authority with an iron fist. Their rule is marked by a delicate balanceâ€”allowing the dragons to dominate their
          territories while intervening only when necessary to maintain their control. The Wuengs are incredibly
          wealthy, rivaling even the oldest dragons, and they command legions of dragons ready to crush any opposition.
          This overwhelming power means they require no standing army of their own, relying instead on their ability to
          summon a chromatic horde at will.</p>

        <h3>The Metallic Cloaks</h3>
        <p>In the shadows of Draconiaâ€™s draconic dominance, a resistance movement known as the Metallic Cloaks fights
          back. Comprised of metallic dragons and their humanoid followers, they operate in secrecy, utilizing their
          ability to polymorph into human forms to avoid detection. These rebels oppose the chromatic dragons and the
          Wueng family, conducting sabotage and guerrilla attacks in their quest to free Draconia from tyrannical rule.
          Despite being hunted across the planet, the Metallic Cloaks persist, driven by their vision of a Draconia free
          from chromatic domination and their hope of rallying the oppressed to their cause.</p>

        <h2 class="details-title">ION</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="details-body">
        <h3>An Undead Planet</h3>
        <p>The history of Ion is enveloped in mystery. It seems to have appeared in the system only recently, as
          historical records from two thousand years ago make no mention of it. The planet remains cloaked in darkness,
          with the sun merely a distant point in the ever-black sky. Its surface is largely barren, with a few densely
          populated cities dependent on food imports from the surrounding moons.</p>
        <p>The majority of Ion's inhabitants are arcane and scientific researchers affiliated with a prestigious academy
          known as "the Beacon," which is controlled by the influential Ntsu family. The Beacon is the sole known
          stronghold of Vecna's cult, where his teachings are both practiced and revered. Here, mages are renowned
          throughout the system for their formidable power and deep arcane knowledge. Ion is a magnet for those seeking
          to elevate their understanding to unparalleled levels, attracting researchers who require that extra spark of
          inspiration.</p>

        <h3>A Planet of Secrets</h3>
        <p>Ion stands as a sanctuary for knowledge and secrets. Every researcher who arrives on the planet must
          relinquish all personal knowledge and allow their entire existence to be cataloged and stored in the vast,
          enigmatic archives of the Beacon. Powerful magic is intricately woven into both the people and the records of
          the Beacon, with information tightly guarded and restricted from casual access. Inhabitants of Ion live in
          accordance with Vecna's demands for secrecy and silence, embracing the weight of the hidden knowledge they
          possess.</p>

        <h3>The Terror</h3>
        <p>In addition to its barren lands, harsh climate, and inhospitable environment, Ion is notorious for one final,
          terrifying aspect: the Terror. This curse is unlike any other, capable of reducing even the mightiest of
          warriors to a state of perpetual child-like fear. Those afflicted by the Terror experience profound dread and
          anxiety that persists until they leave the planet, often leaving them traumatized. The origins and selection
          criteria of the Terror remain unknown, and there is no known cure. The only escape for those struck by this
          curse is to depart Ion permanently.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>From nothing, I suddenly felt everything, thousand souls, things, animals demons and all what life has ever
            shown me and then more. Then they turned, evil no human can hold washing over me, taking me, burning me,
            torturing me. All was black, no life, no thought. I cried, I screamed, I was nowhere and everywhere. One
            thing was clear, death was the only hope. I was no more in spirit, I hoped for my body to follow. Never I
            will touch that cursed land, ever again.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>The Ntsu Family</h3>
        <p>The Ntsu family is a shadowy and enigmatic power within the Stardom, ruling from their remote and secretive
          home planet, Ion. Known for their control over the Beaconâ€”an unparalleled institution of advanced magicâ€”the
          Ntsu maintain a discreet presence, rarely stepping into the public eye except in the company of other
          influential families. They wield their influence from the shadows, expertly maneuvering through political and
          magical intrigues to achieve their goals, while ensuring that their vast reservoirs of arcane knowledge remain
          strictly controlled and hidden from those they deem unworthy.</p>

        <h4>A Family of Knowledge</h4>
        <p>The Ntsu family is deeply committed to the principles of Vecna, the god of undeath and secrets. Their mission
          is to protect and preserve arcane knowledge, keeping it out of the hands of those they consider untrustworthy.
          The Beacon, the familyâ€™s prestigious academy, stands as a testament to their dedication to the arcane arts.
          This institution attracts the most ambitious and brilliant minds in the Stardom, offering them unparalleled
          training and access to forbidden knowledge.</p>
        <p>The Ntsu themselves are rumored to be centuries old, with their exact age and the origins of their magical
          techniques remaining a closely guarded secret. Their mastery of magic is legendary, with few in the Stardom
          able to rival their expertise. The familyâ€™s members are known to possess unique and potent magical abilities
          that are hidden from the general public, adding to their mystique and the fear they instill in others.</p>

        <h2 class="details-title">SALTAR</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="details-body">
        <h3>A Hollow World of Caverns and Darkness</h3>
        <p>The surface of Saltar is barren, with craters and pores leading to deep underground civilizations of drow
          (dark elves). These caverns are illuminated by bioluminescent fungi and glowing crystals, where drow cities
          cling to cavern walls, connected by bridges and tunnels.</p>

        <h3>The Blue Sea: A Watery Sphere of Power</h3>
        <p>At Saltar's core lies the <strong>Blue Sea</strong>, a glowing, two-mile-wide sphere of water suspended in
          the hollow planet. It generates powerful lightning, which the drow harness for arcane rituals and defense.</p>

        <h3>A Planet Without an Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>Saltar's lack of atmosphere leaves its surface exposed to space. The drow stargazers study the stars from the
          cavern entrances, unhindered by atmospheric distortion.</p>

        <h3>The Ousssek Family</h3>
        <p>The Ousssek family rules the drow on Saltar, devoted to Lolth and driven by ruthless ambition. They encourage
          internal conflict to strengthen their society, extending their power across the Stardom with a powerful fleet
          and a network of deadly assassins known as the Red Dot.</p>

        <h2 class="details-title">WANDACKER</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="details-body">
        <h3>The Blood Plains</h3>
        <p>Wandacker's northern hemisphere is dominated by rugged landscapes and red-hued steppes. Its surface is often
          assaulted by "Maelstorms"â€”toxic mercury tornadoes that originate from black seas, spreading destruction across
          the land.</p>

        <h3>Borzatium</h3>
        <p><strong>Borzatium</strong> is a rare mineral that retains the properties of iron but can be shaped through
          magic. This makes it a highly sought-after resource for crafting, though its extraction is fraught with
          danger.</p>

        <h3>An Uninhabitable Planet</h3>
        <p>Despite its natural beauty, Wandacker is overrun by vicious gnolls. These relentless creatures make the
          fertile lands dangerous and force civilization into fortified mountain peaks, where valuable resources like
          Borzatium are still within reach but require daring expeditions to secure.</p>

        <h3>The Amoako Family</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Amoako family</strong> are the premier miners of the system, wielding a formidable fleet and army
          dedicated to extracting Wandacker's resources. They have no terrestrial land, living instead in space stations
          that orbit the planet, from which they manage their extensive mining operations.</p>

        <h4>No Land, But the Stars</h4>
        <p>Operating from space stations, the Amoako family oversees mining operations on Wandacker through independent
          contractors. These stations, a marvel of engineering, are the heart of their wealth and influence, allowing
          them to challenge even the greatest industrial powers in the system.</p>

        <h4>A Mineral for a Man: The Economy of Extraction</h4>
        <p>The Amoako familyâ€™s wealth comes from taxing the contractors who mine the planetâ€™s resources. Itâ€™s a harsh,
          high-risk system, but for many, itâ€™s the only option. The constant threat of gnoll attacks keeps the stakes
          high, driving the familyâ€™s relentless pursuit of profit amidst danger.</p>
