        <h3>The Sun and Space Sides: Fire and Ice</h3>
        <p>On the Sun Side, Fire Genasi navigate a molten landscape, sailing across seas of lava in heat-resistant
          ships. They extract valuable minerals from the fiery depths, thriving in an environment where the air shimmers
          with intense, unbearable heat. Meanwhile, on the Space Side, Air Genasi soar over frozen expanses, harvesting
          rare crystals from towering ice formations. Their ships, built to withstand the biting cold, cut through the
          ice, uncovering treasures that have been preserved for centuries.</p>

        <h3>The Twilight Border: A Delicate Balance</h3>
        <p>Between these two extremes lies the twilight border, where cities carefully balance fire and ice to create
          habitable spaces. The Sudriz family, rulers of Hellcoast, personify this balance. Known for their mediocrity
          and methodical governance, they maintain a stable yet unremarkable reignâ€”reflecting the delicate equilibrium
          of their divided world.</p>

      <div class="details-body">
        <h3>A Deserted Landscape</h3>
        <p>Jetaras is a largely arid, inhospitable wasteland. Temperatures often soar above 50Â°C (122Â°F), transforming
          the land into a cracked, barren expanse of earth and rock. Dust storms frequently sweep across this harsh
          terrain, making both travel and survival a constant challenge. The only refuge from the relentless heat is
          found in the rare shade of shelters or within the towering Ultracities, which rise from the desert like
          colossal oases.
        </p>
        <h3>The Three Great Plateaus and Ultracities</h3>
        <p>The planet's three massive plateaus are home to the Ultracities, sprawling urban centers housing over a
          hundred million people. These cities, dominated by towering "Work Towers," are marvels of human engineering.
          Each Ultracity is a self-contained world, divided into sectors for industry, commerce, and living spaces.
          Surrounding these towers are vast slums, where life is a daily struggle against poverty and oppression.
          Despite the harsh conditions, the slums are vibrant with culture, filled with bustling markets, music, and a
          strong sense of community.
        </p>
        <h3>The Warlord Provinces</h3>
        <p>Beyond the plateaus lie the Warlord Provinces, a lawless expanse ruled by powerful warlords who govern with
          an iron fist. Private armies patrol these territories, which are plagued by marauding ravagers preying on the
          weak. Caravans crossing these dangerous regions are constantly at risk of attack, yet trade remains essential.
          As a result, caravans continue their journeys, heavily guarded and always on high alert.
        </p>
        <h3>The Mitsumoro Family</h3>
        <p>The Mitsumoro family, one of the three most powerful in the Stardom, rules over Jetaras with a blend of
          cunning and ruthlessness. They maintain control through a complex network of contracts that bind every citizen
          to them from birth. Their chosen deity, Asmodeus, the archdevil of indulgence, influences their reign. Under
          his influence, the Mitsumoro have built a society where pleasure, wealth, and power are paramount. Despite
          their hedonistic lifestyle, the Mitsumoro are master manipulators, ensuring that any challenge to their
          dominance is swiftly neutralized.</p>

        <h3>The Void: A Shattered Graveyard</h3>
        <p>The Void is all that remains of the once-thriving planet of Meerswelt. Now, it is a desolate expanseâ€”a
          shattered graveyard of floating debris, where countless asteroids drift through the cold, empty darkness.
          These fragments, the remnants of the old world, are scattered across the cosmos like shards of a forgotten
          dream.</p>

        <h3>The Abyss: A Gateway to Destruction</h3>
        <p>At the center of this vast, ruined sea, a greenish vapor swirls, becoming denser and darker as one approaches
          the middle. This fog is thick with an otherworldly malevolence, a suffocating miasma that clings to everything
          it touches. At its core lies a small, insatiable black hole, drawing all matter into its depthsâ€”a one-way
          ticket to the Abyss, a gateway to a realm of destruction and death.</p>

        <h3>Survival Amidst the Ruins</h3>
        <p>Yet even here, amidst the ruins, some survive. On the larger asteroids, pockets of determined warriors and
          exiles carve out a fragile existence. They fight to survive among the rocks, battling relentless waves of
          demons and horrors that emerge from the Abyssâ€”facing the very embodiment of chaos and annihilation.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>A Warped Planet</h3>
        <h3>The Transformed Landscapes of Draconia</h3>
        <p>Draconia, once a world of vibrant prairies, has been irreversibly transformed by the magical influence of its
          dragon rulers. Each type of chromatic dragon has claimed a portion of the planet, warping the landscape to
          mirror their elemental powers. The ancient Red Dragons have turned towering mountains into active volcanoes,
          with rivers of molten lava flowing through their domains. In the deep chasms ruled by the Black Dragons,
          sulfuric acid lakes bubble ominously, while the White Dragons have plunged their territories into frozen
          tundras where temperatures drop far below zero. The seas, governed by the Blue Dragons, are engulfed in
          perpetual storms, crackling with electrical discharges that make navigation treacherous. Meanwhile, the Green
          Dragons preside over lush, dangerous jungles teeming with monstrous creatures. These transformed landscapes
          create isolated and hostile environments, where only the strongest can survive.</p>

        <h3>The Wueng Family: Rulers of the Chromatic Dragons</h3>
        <p>Dominating this fractured world is the Wueng family, descendants of Zai Wueng, the Voice of Tiamat. Blessed
          by the Dragon Queen herself, the Wuengs possess the power to command the chromatic dragons, ruling with an
          iron fist. Their rule is a delicate balanceâ€”allowing dragons to dominate their territories while intervening
          only when necessary to maintain overall control. Incredibly wealthy, rivaling even the oldest dragons, the
          Wueng family commands legions of dragons capable of crushing any opposition. With such overwhelming power,
          they require no standing army of their own, instead relying on their ability to summon a chromatic horde at
          will.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="details-body">
        <h3>The Mysterious Origins of Ion</h3>
        <p>The history of Ion is shrouded in mystery. The planet seems to have appeared in the system only recently, as
          historical records from two thousand years ago make no mention of it. Cloaked in perpetual darkness, with the
          sun a mere distant point in the ever-black sky, Ion's surface is largely barren, dotted with a few densely
          populated cities dependent on food imports from the surrounding moons.</p>

        <h3>The Beacon and the Power of Vecna</h3>
        <p>Most of Ion's inhabitants are arcane and scientific researchers, affiliated with a prestigious academy known
          as "The Beacon," controlled by the influential Ntsu family. The Beacon is the only known stronghold of Vecna's
          cult, where his teachings are both practiced and revered. Mages from Ion are renowned throughout the system
          for their formidable power and deep arcane knowledge. The planet draws those seeking to elevate their
          understanding, attracting researchers in search of that extra spark of inspiration.</p>

        <h3>A Sanctuary of Secrets</h3>
        <p>Ion is a sanctuary for knowledge and secrets. Every researcher who arrives must relinquish all personal
          knowledge and allow their entire existence to be cataloged and stored in the vast, enigmatic archives of The
          Beacon. Powerful magic is intricately woven into both the people and the records of The Beacon, ensuring
          information is tightly guarded and inaccessible to the casual seeker. Inhabitants of Ion live by Vecna's
          demands for secrecy and silence, embracing the weight of the hidden knowledge they possess.</p>

        <h3>The Terror: A Curse of Fear</h3>
        <p>Beyond its barren lands, harsh climate, and inhospitable environment, Ion is infamous for one terrifying
          aspect: the Terror. This curse can reduce even the strongest warriors to a state of perpetual, child-like
          fear. Those afflicted by the Terror experience profound dread and anxiety, persisting until they leave the
          planetâ€”often leaving them traumatized. The origins of the Terror, and the criteria by which it chooses its
          victims, remain unknown. There is no known cure, and the only escape is to leave Ion permanently.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>From nothing, I suddenly felt everything: a thousand souls, things, animals, demons, and all that life had
            ever shown meâ€”then more. Then they turned, evil no human can hold, washing over me, taking me, burning me,
            torturing me. All was black: no life, no thought. I cried, I screamed, I was nowhere and everywhere. One
            thing was clear: death was the only hope. I was no more in spirit, and I hoped my body would follow. Never
            will I touch that cursed land again.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The Ntsu family is a shadowy and enigmatic power within the Stardom, ruling from their remote and secretive
          home planet, Ion. Known for their control over The Beaconâ€”an unparalleled institution of advanced magicâ€”the
          Ntsu maintain a discreet presence, rarely stepping into the public eye except in the company of other
          influential families. They wield their influence from the shadows, expertly navigating political and magical
          intrigues to achieve their goals, all while ensuring their vast reserves of arcane knowledge remain hidden
          from those deemed unworthy.</p>

        <h3>Vecnaâ€™s Devotees</h3>
        <p>The Ntsu family is deeply committed to the principles of Vecna, the god of undeath and secrets. Their mission

        <h2 class="details-title">SALTAR</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="details-body">
        <h3>A Barren Surface, A Hidden Civilization</h3>
        <p>The surface of Saltar is a barren expanse, marked by craters and deep pores that lead to vast underground
          civilizations inhabited by the drow (dark elves). These subterranean caverns are illuminated by bioluminescent
          fungi and glowing crystals. Drow cities cling to the cavern walls, connected by a network of bridges and
          tunnels that span the depths.</p>

        <h3>The Glowing Sea of Saltar</h3>
        <p>At the core of Saltar lies the Sea, a glowing, two-mile-wide sphere of water suspended within the hollow
          planet. This mysterious sea generates powerful lightning, which the drow harness for arcane rituals and as a
          formidable defense mechanism.</p>

        <h3>A Planet Without an Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>Saltar's lack of atmosphere leaves its surface fully exposed to the void of space. From the cavern entrances,
          drow stargazers study the stars without the interference of atmospheric distortion, providing them with
          unparalleled clarity.</p>

        <h3>The Ousssek Family: Rulers of Saltar</h3>
        <p>The Ousssek family rules the drow on Saltar, with an unwavering devotion to Lolth and a fierce ambition. They
          foster internal conflict to strengthen their society, extending their influence throughout the Stardom with a
          powerful fleet and a network of assassins known as the Red Dot.</p>

        <h2 class="details-title">WANDACKER</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="details-body">
        <h3>The Blood Plains</h3>
        <p>The northern hemisphere of Wandacker is dominated by rugged landscapes and red-hued steppes. Its surface is
          frequently assaulted by "Maelstorms"â€”toxic mercury tornadoes that rise from black seas, spreading destruction
          across the land.</p>

        <h3>Borzatium</h3>
        <p><strong>Borzatium</strong> is a rare mineral that retains the properties of iron but can be shaped through
          magic, making it a highly sought-after resource for crafting. However, its extraction is fraught with danger.
        </p>

        <h3>An Uninhabitable Planet</h3>
        <p>Despite its natural beauty, Wandacker is overrun by vicious gnolls. These relentless creatures make the
          fertile lands perilous, forcing civilization into fortified mountain peaks. From these heights, valuable
          resources like Borzatium can still be accessed, but securing them requires daring expeditions.</p>

        <h3>The Amoako Family</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Amoako family</strong> are the foremost miners in the system, commanding a formidable fleet and
          army dedicated to extracting Wandacker's resources. They do not claim any land on the planet, living instead
          in space stations orbiting Wandacker, from where they manage their extensive mining operations.</p>

        <h4>No Land, But the Stars</h4>
        <p>From their space stations, the Amoako family oversees mining on Wandacker through independent contractors.
          These stations, marvels of engineering, are the core of their wealth and influence, enabling them to rival
          even the most powerful industrial forces in the system.</p>

        <h4>A Mineral for a Man: The Economy of Extraction</h4>
        <p>The Amoako familyâ€™s fortune stems from taxing the contractors who mine the planetâ€™s resources. It's a harsh,
          high-risk system, but for many, it's the only way. The ever-present threat of gnoll attacks keeps the stakes
          high, fueling the family's relentless pursuit of profit in a dangerous environment.</p>

        <h2 class="details-title">Xan</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="details-body">
        <h3>The Endless Siege</h3>
        <p>Xan is a planet locked in perpetual conflict, where vibrant yet perilous flora thrives across its lush
          surface. The dense vegetation, both visually stunning and dangerously aggressive, serves as a natural defense,
          augmenting the planetâ€™s fortified architecture. Every inch of the landscape is a battleground, with the
          planetâ€™s rich ecosystems fiercely protected by both nature and design.</p>
        <h3>The Giff and the Heretics</h3>
        <p>Xanâ€™s inhabitants are divided into two primary groups: the <strong>Giff</strong> and the
          <strong>Heretics</strong>. The Giff, known for their immense size and military prowess, are the planetâ€™s
          defenders. They have established a vast network of fortified strongholds across Xan, each one a bastion of
          protection against external threats. Strategically placed, these fortresses ensure the defense of Xanâ€™s unique
          ecosystems while maintaining a constant state of readiness.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast, the Heretics are an enigmatic and elusive faction. Their goals often clash with the Giff,
          resulting in internal strife and power struggles. Despite their differences, both groups share a common goal:
          the preservation of Xanâ€™s thriving environment, though their methods are worlds apart.</p>
        <h3>The Inner Sun</h3>
        <p>One of Xanâ€™s most remarkable features is its hollow interior, where the Giff have created an
          <strong>artificial sun</strong>. This marvel of engineering and magic provides the necessary light and warmth
          to sustain the planet's surface and powers the intricate artificial ecosystems within. It is not just a source
          of energy, but a vital component in Xanâ€™s life-support system, fueling the creation of simulated food sources
          that sustain both the Giff and the Heretics.
        </p>
        <p>This miniature sun keeps the delicate balance of life on Xan intact, even amidst the constant turmoil.
          Without it, the planetâ€™s unique flora and faunaâ€”and its inhabitantsâ€”could not survive the endless siege.</p>
        <h3>The Struggle for Survival</h3>
        <p>Life on Xan is defined by perpetual vigilance. Overpopulation and the constant threat of attack have shaped a
          culture built around defense and survival. Fortresses and defensive structures are not merely military
          outposts but essential components of the planetâ€™s infrastructure, supporting its aggressive flora while
          protecting its inhabitants.</p>
        <p>Despite the beauty and richness of Xan, its splendor comes at a high price. The blood spilled by those who
          defend it serves as a reminder of the unrelenting struggle to safeguard such a valuable world. Yet, even under
          the pressure of unceasing conflict, Xan remains unconquerable, a symbol of resilience and defiance in the face
          of never-ending adversity.</p>
